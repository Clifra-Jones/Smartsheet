# Powershell Module for the Smartsheet API

This module allows you to interact with the Smartsheet REST API using powershell.  
This module is 100% powershell and does not use the c# SDK available from smartsheet.
I wanted to not require including any additional .dll files to use this module. All calls tothe API are done through the Invoke-RestMethod function.
